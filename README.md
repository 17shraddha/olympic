🏅 Olympic Data Analysis  EDA

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (EDAA.ipynb) that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Olympic historical data.
The analysis focuses on understanding athlete demographics, participation trends, medal performance, and country-wise patterns across different Olympic years.

📘 Overview
The goal of this project is to explore how Olympic athletes and countries have performed over time by analyzing:
Athlete characteristics (age, height, weight, gender)
Participation patterns across years and events
Medal distribution and performance trends
Country-wise dominance in different sports
Key insights and correlations that describe Olympic evolution
This notebook serves as a foundation for understanding the structure, quality, and hidden patterns of Olympic datasets.

🧑‍🦽 Athlete Data Analysis

A major part of the notebook focuses on analyzing athletes, which includes:
1. Athlete Demographics
We examine basic characteristics of athletes such as:
Age distribution
Height and weight variations
Gender participation ratio
How these demographics change across years or sports

Insight Example:
Athletes aged 20–30 form the largest group, with sport-specific variations (e.g., gymnasts are younger, basketball players taller).
2. Participation Trends
Patterns observed include:
Increase in the number of athletes over decades
Most represented countries
Most popular sports by athlete count
Insight Example:
Athlete participation increased significantly after the 1980s, indicating global expansion of the Olympics.

3. Performance & Medal Analysis
We analyze:
Top medal-winning athletes
Countries with highest medal counts
Relationship between age and medal probability
Athletes with multiple Olympic appearances
Insight Example:
Athletes aged 23–28 tend to win more medals, especially in sports like swimming and athletics.

4. Sport-Specific Analysis
Each sport has a unique athlete profile:
Gymnasts are generally younger
Track athletes show broader height and weight ranges
Swimmers have higher average height
This highlights physical requirements across sports.

5. Interesting Athlete Patterns
Examples include:
Youngest and oldest athletes
Athletes competing in multiple sports
Countries dominating specific events
Medal streaks across years
These findings help create meaningful storytelling in the analysis.

📊 Key Insights From the Notebook

(You may update this section based on your results)
USA, China, and Russia dominate overall medal counts
Athlete participation grew sharply after 1980
Women's participation has risen significantly
Height and weight vary strongly by sport
Moderate correlation exists between age and medal performance
Certain countries dominate specific sports (e.g., Kenya in long-distance running)
